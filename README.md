## Overview

This repository contains my archived solutions to algorithm and data structure problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/donjuuso/), automatically synced using [`glsync`](https://github.com/ahmed-e-abdulaziz/glsync).  
All solutions are written exclusively in **C#** as part of a focused effort to deepen my mastery of the language through algorithmic problem-solving.

---

## Goals

- Strengthen practical fluency in modern **C#**
- Build a structured and version-controlled archive of solutions
- Maintain consistency in long-term technical self-improvement
- Showcase algorithmic thinking and code clarity in a public portfolio

---

## Tooling and Workflow

- `glsync` for automated LeetCode-to-GitHub synchronization  
- **C#** as the sole language for all solutions  
- Git and GitHub for version control
